          <p>
            Mutualize, and Mutualize logo ("Mutualize Logo"), either separately
            or in combination, are hereinafter referred to as "Mutualize
            Trademarks" and are trademarks of Mutualize. Except as provided in
            these guidelines, you may not use the Mutualize Trademarks or any
            confusingly similar mark as a trademark for your product, or use the
            Mutualize Trademarks in any other manner that might cause confusion
            in the marketplace, including but not limited to in advertising, on
            websites, or on software. Mutualize protects the Mutualize
            Trademarks on behalf of the entire open source community. In fact,
            the law obligates trademark owners to police their marks and prevent
            the use of confusingly similar names by third parties. If you have
            questions about this policy, please contact Adaline Simonian at

          <p>
            One of the purposes of Mutualize is to encourage the use of
            Mutualize Software to enable the public to come to trust the use of
            Mutualize Trademarks. To achieve this purpose it is important that
            Mutualize Software can quickly be identified. Mutualize has chosen
            the Mutualize Logo to identify such software and is granting usage
            rights in the Mutualize Logo (and the other Mutualize Trademarks) as
            previously described in this document in order to assure widespread
            availability.

              <p>
                Sometimes, often due to production costs, only one colour of ink
                is available and so Mutualize Logo must be reproduced using only
                one colour. In this scenario, the logo, logotype, or symbol must
                be used following the convention of using a light colour type on
                a dark background or in a dark colour type on a light
                background. The logotype and/or symbol outline must be clearly
                distinguishable from the background colour. You must honor the
                Mutualize Logo palette when possible, using black or white if
                necessary.
